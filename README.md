# Casa Domus

## About the Project
Casa Domus is a group effort from six students for our Software Engineering class. The project was created by a customer specifically for our group and is unique compared to projects given to other groups in the class. The project was assigned with 2-3 months to collaborate together and produce not only a working web service, but also formal documentation on every step of the project.

## About the Web Service
The goal of Casa Domus is provide accurate and completely free map of affordable housing at the county level. Our results are systematically chosen to match your ideal living conditions. Our interface runs within any Google Chrome 60.0+ or Firefox 58.0+ on a desktop client.
